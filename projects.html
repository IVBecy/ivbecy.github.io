            <p>Since I have re-designed the whole website back in May 2020, I wanted to do something that was again related to python.
               It is not hard, to figure out that I am really into hacking, and that I love making tools, that break already working stuff.
               In this case I wanted to build a Password Cracker tool. The concept is, that you take a file full of hashes, then a
               password file, full of random words, hash every word in the password file, then compare it to the hash file.
               If there is any match, then the hash was succesfully "broken". I know, it is not the most advanced stuff, that I could
               come up, iwth but it seemd like a great idea, and it only took about 4-5 hours.

          <p> As of June 2 2020, I have completely re-designed my website. Before it had an "arcade" look.
            I was happy with it, but I felt like, giving the website a more "professional" look, would make it
            more appealing to someone, who would visit the website for the 1st time. So the old version was colorful,
            it mostly contained, blue, pink, cyan, and purple colour. The new one is more minimalist, and it just looks
            better in my opinion. You can still check the old version out, by clicking on the picture below.

            <p> Since the Instagram attack, I wanted to use selenium, as I found it interesting.
                So, I've got an idea, I was sure that I wanted to make a GUI app.
                Then I realised that I could do something that checks the price of a product.
                I chose amazon, as the base of my project, because that seemed easy.
                I have finished the project in 1 night (roughly 5-6 hours).
                The 2 most important module that I have used are: Tkinter, and Selenium.
                I have published the app both in PY and EXE format.

            <p> Back in 2019 I have made a Space Invaders "game", but it was a catastrophy.
                So now, that I have more experience in programming, I have remade it.
                I have used Python, and mostly the turtle module. The programm itself was pretty easy to
                implement, as I was able to use some mechanics from my Flappy Bird game, such as gravity.
                With all the code, and the design, it took about 2-3 days to finish it.
                The game is available both in PY and EXE format.

            <p> After making Slow Loris, I felt like its the path I want to work more on.
              So I made an Instagram dictionary attack, which uses TOR.
              I implemented this in Python, using the selenium module for generating the webpage and handling the
              attack, plus the requests. I also used stem, to change IP whenever it was needed.
              This project was done, roughly in two days.

            <p>   Slow Loris is a DoS method, which anyone can use even with a low bandwith.
              It is making numerous connections to a webserver, then sending data every 10 / 15 seconds,
              just when the webserver would close the connection, so that it would not close.
              I made 2 versions of this script. One you can use with your own IP, but that is not,
              recommended. The second script, is using TOR Proxies, so your IP won't be visible.
              Both of the scripts are written using Python.

            <p>I made this game both in Python and javascript, but I will only talk about the Javascript
               version, as I feel like the Python one, was a bit of a fail. I will probably remake it in the
               future, as I got much better since.
               So, as I mentioned the Python version was a big fail, and since I shifted to JS, I wanted
                to give it another try. In a few days, I learnt the basics of JS so I got going and
                it was much easier to write, than the Python implementation. After a few days of
                programming I finished the game, so that it worked both on PCs and Phones.

            <p>  The inspiration to make this app came from one of my friends. He asked me if I use password managers.
              I said, no. But than something clicked.
              People pay for these services, so instead of paying for a password manager, why not make my own?!
              I had to learn Tkinter, for this project, but it went overall pretty well.
              In about a week, I made a usable Password Manager, that can store passwords,
              and encrypt (only the login password) in Sha1.
