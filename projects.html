    <!--Old Website-->
    <h2   onclick="old_website()">Old Website</h2>
    <div id="p_old_website" style="display: none">
    <p> As of June 2 2020, I have completely re-designed my website. Before it had an "arcade" look.
      I was happy with it, but I felt like, giving the website a more "professional" look, would make it
      more appealing to someone, who would visit the website for the 1st time. So the old version was colorful,
      it mostly contained, blue, pink, cyan, and purple colour. The new one is more minimalist, and it just looks
      better in my opinion. You can still check the old version out, by click in the picture below.

    <div id="p_amazon" style="display: none">
    <p> Since the Instagram attack, I wanted to use selenium, as I found it interesting.
        So, I've got an idea, I was sure that I wanted to make a GUI app.
        Then I realised that I could do something that checks the price of a product.
        I chose amazon, as the base of my project, because that seemed easy.
        I have finished the project in 1 night (roughly 5-6 hours).
        The 2 most important module that I have used are: Tkinter, and Selenium.
        I have published the app both in PY and EXE format.

      <div id="p_space" style="display: none">
      <p> Back in 2019 I have made a Space Invaders "game", but it was a catastrophy.
          So now, that I have more experience in programming, I have remade it.
          I have used Python, and mostly the turtle module. The programm itself was pretty easy to
          implement, as I was able to use some mechanics from my Flappy Bird game, such as gravity.
          With all the code, and the design, it took about 2-3 days to finish it.
          The game is available both in PY and EXE format.

      <div id="p_insta" style="display: none">
      <p> After making Slow Loris, I felt like its the path I want to work more on.
        So I made an Instagram dictionary attack, which uses TOR.
        I implemented this in Python, using the selenium module for generating the webpage and handling the
        attack, plus the requests. I also used stem, to change IP whenever it was needed.
        This project was done, roughly in two days.

      <div id="p_slow" style="display: none">
      <p>
        Slow Loris is a DoS method, which anyone can use even with a low bandwith.
        It is making numerous connections to a webserver, then sending data every 10 / 15 seconds,
        just when the webserver would close the connection, so that it would not close.
        I made 2 versions of this script. One you can use with your own IP, but that is not,
        recommended. The second script, is using TOR Proxies, so your IP won't be visible.
        Both of the scripts are written using Python.</p>

      <!--Password Manager-->

      <div id="p_pass" style="display: none">
      <p>
        The inspiration to make this app came from one of my friends. He asked me if I use password managers.
        I said, no. But than something clicked.
        People pay for these services, so instead of paying for a password manager, why not make my own?!
        I had to learn Tkinter, for this project, but it went overall pretty well.
        In about a week, I made a usable Password Manager, that can store passwords,
        and encrypt (only the login password) in Sha1.</p>

      <h2  onclick="flappy()" >Flappy Bird </h2>
      <div id = "p_flappy" style="display: none">
      <p>I made this game both in Python and javascript, but I will only talk about the Javascript
         version, as I feel like the Python one, was a bit of a fail. I will probably remake it in the
         future, as I got much better since.
         So, as I mentioned the Python version was a big fail, and since I shifted to JS, I wanted
          to give it another try. In a few days, I learnt the basics of JS so I got going and
          it was much easier to write, than the Python implementation. After a few days of
          programming I finished the game, so that it worked both on PCs and Phones.
          I made some designs (background, buttons, score board) and published the game here
          on my website. You can find it in the <a href="games.html">GAMES</a> section. </p>

      <p>Obviously my biggest project is, this website.<br>
        I started making my website so that I will be able to write in HTML, CSS and JS.
        I also wanted a place where I would be able to, document my projects throughout my programming,
        "carrer". I believe that this website was needed for me, to be really proud of what I do.
        Also this is not just a one timer project. It will last years, as I will always update it.

      <p>Being a self described nerd, I was interested in programming, and I was desperate to make my own game
        This was my very first game, written in Python, by using the Turtle Module. Roughly it took 2 weeks
        to finsih it. After that I knew all the basic syntaxes of Turtle and I was ready for a new challenge.
