    <br>
    <br>
    <p>As I said, I do more programming than ever. I have realised that I had to choose a path in life.
       Since I was not interested in anything else, I took it to a whole other level. For example during
       the 2020 Covid-19 period, I was coding 9-16 hours a day. Straight from when I got up, to when I went to sleep.
       Too much I know. But I was always so excited to learn and to do something more, that I did not know yesterday.
       That is the overall, "feeling" that got me into programming. The feeling that I am happier and more successful
       than I ever was in anything else. In a normal school day, I wake up, go to school, get home, do my school stuff,
       then coding until noon. I hope that this much of commitment will pay off in the form of me getting good grades, jobs
       and a good life.
       <br>
       <br>
       So if you would ask me what will I do next...<br>
       Wouldn't the answer be obvious?!
